# Title

A Tool-kit Of Techniques To Make Computer Vision Models Easier To Train And Evaluate

# Abstract (150)

Machine learning techniques, especially in the area of computer vision, have opened a new frontier of research and industry - however the initial cost of entry into the field is a boundary, especially in developing economies. There are many techniques and approaches to optimising these work-flows in order to make them more computationally efficient, and therefore cheaper. Such techniques include traditional software engineering, data and signals processing, as well as more advanced optimisations to the model structures and training pipelines to make the process more efficient. These techniques have trade-offs and are task dependant but when combined appropriately can be a powerful tool-kit to improve computability of large work-flows. This poster evaluates a selection of techniques aimed at making computer vision easier to compute in memory usage, processor load, and time. These techniques are not always appropriate, and therefore several different types of tasks are considered.
